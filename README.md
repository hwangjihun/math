# My Math Learning Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my journey in learning various areas of mathematics, including pre-calculus, calculus, and plans for future topics such as linear algebra and discrete mathematics. The goal is to build my foundation back as I have not touched math in a long time. Topics that are checked ✅ are considered finished.

## Study Plan

### 1. Get ready for Pre-Calculus
Starting with Khan Academy's comprehensive get ready pre-calculus course:

- Get Ready for Complex numbers ✅
- Get Ready for Polynomials ✅
- Get Ready for Composite and Inverse Functions ✅
- Get Ready for Trigonometry 
- Get Ready for Vectors and Matrices
- Get Ready for Series 
- Get Ready for Conic Sections
- Get Ready for Probability and Combinatorics 

**Resource:** [Khan Academy Pre-Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/get-ready-for-precalculus)

### 2. Pre-Calculus
Starting with Khan Academy's comprehensive pre-calculus course:

- Complex numbers
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Conics
- Trigonometry
- Probability and combinatorics

**Resource:** [Khan Academy Pre-Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus)

### 3. Future Topics
I plan to explore these areas in the future:

- Linear Algebra
- Discrete Mathematics

(Specific resources and study plans for these topics will be added later)

## Progress Tracking
I'll use this repository to:
- Track completed topics and exercises
- Store notes and summaries of key concepts
- Document challenging problems and their solutions
- Reflect on my learning process and insights gained

## Goals
- Complete Khan Academy Pre-Calculus course by [target date]
- Work through Calculus materials (Khan Academy and MIT) by [target date]
- Explore Linear Algebra and Discrete Mathematics (timeline to be determined)

## Resources
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)
- [MIT OpenCourseWare Mathematics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/)
- [Additional textbooks or online resources] (To be added for each topic)
